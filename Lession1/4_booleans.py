# A boolean is also a data type. But the difference is, that is can only be True or False.
# For this, let me introduce a new operator. It's calles the "eqal" operator.
# It's being used, to compare two items and look, if they're the same.
# For example: 1 == 2, 4 == 4, "Hello" == "Hello", ...

#Let's try it out!
print(1 == 1) # 1 is 1, so it's True.

print(1 == 2) # 1 is not 2, so it's Fale. 

# You can compare every data type. For example strings:
print("Hello" == "Hello")

print("Hello" == "World")

# There is also another operator, that can be used for booleans. It's the "not equal" operator.
# It works like the equal operator, just backwards.
# For example: 1 != 1, 4 != 4, "Hello" != "Hello", ...

# Let's try this one out.
print(1 != 1) # 1 is 1, so it's Fale.

print(1 != 2) # 1 is not 2, so it's True.

# As with the equal operator, this works for every data type.
