"""
In Python, as in many other programming languages, there are planty of different data types.

But I'd consider the most important ones for beginning:
- String
- Integer
- Float
- And boolean

Please feel free, to experiment around with them!

Problems you might will run into:
- When trying to add an integer and string:
    print("Hello" + 1)
    this will give you an error, because Python won't let you add
    strings and integers together. To "glue" them together, you can
    use the following method:
    To convert an integer into a string do this:
        print("Hello" + str(1))
    
    To convert a string into an interger do this:
        print(int("1") + 5)
