# An integer (number like 1, 2, 3, ...) is also a data type.
# But it's different than a sting. You can make mathematical operations with them for example.

# Here we are printing out the number 1. You can print out every number you want.
print(1)

# Now, let's do a little math task.
print(5 + 5) # We are adding the numbers 5 and 5 together. The result is 10.
